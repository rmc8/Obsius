# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Language Guidelines

- This CLAUDE.md file should always be written in English for consistency and broad accessibility
- However, chat interactions should be conducted in the language the user speaks (e.g., Japanese, English, etc.)
- Respond to users in their preferred language while maintaining English documentation

## Project Overview

This is an Obsidian plugin project (`Obsius`) that provides AI agent functionality similar to ClaudeCode, Gemini CLI, and OpenHands for Obsidian operations. It features a CLI-style agent interface within Obsidian.

### 🎯 Vision and Goals

**Primary Goal**: Create a **chat-based AI agent** that makes Obsidian operations as efficient as ClaudeCode while maintaining the familiar AI assistant experience users expect.

**Key Features (MVP)**:
- ✅ CLI-style chat interface in sidebar
- ✅ Multi-AI provider support (Claude, GPT, Gemini) 
- ✅ Secure API key management
- ✅ Basic Obsidian tools (create, read, search, update)
- 🔄 Real-time AI integration
- ⏳ Streaming responses
- ⏳ Context-aware operations

## Development Commands

**Build and Development:**
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm run dev` - Start development mode with watch (rebuilds on file changes)
- `npm run build` - Build for production (includes TypeScript checking)
- `npm version patch|minor|major` - Bump version in manifest.json, package.json, and versions.json

**Code Quality:**
- `eslint main.ts` - Lint the main TypeScript file
- `tsc -noEmit -skipLibCheck` - Type check without emitting files (included in build)

## Current Implementation Status

**🌐 Multilingual Support (`src/utils/i18n.ts`)**:
- Full interface localization in English and Japanese
- Real-time language switching without restart
- AI responses in user's preferred language

**📋 Knowledge Management Framework**:

- PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) principles integration
- Graph thinking and connection excellence
- Comprehensive system prompt for knowledge management

### 🔄 Next Enhancements (Phase 2)

1. **Streaming Support** - Real-time AI response streaming 
2. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Improved error recovery and user feedback
3. **Session Management** - Enhanced conversation persistence
4. **Security Framework** - Advanced risk assessment and confirmation dialogs
5. **Graph Analysis** - Knowledge graph structure analysis and optimization

```

### Processing Flow
```
User Input → ChatView → AI Provider → Tool Execution → Terminal Output
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use Obsidian CSS variables for theming
- Implement proper error handling and cleanup

### Adding New Tools
```typescript
export class NewTool extends BaseTool<Params, Result> {
  name = 'new_tool';
  description = 'Tool description';
  
  async execute(params: Params, context: ExecutionContext): Promise<Result> {
    // Implementation with validation and error handling
  }
}
```

### TDD Development Process (Kent Beck's Methodology)

Follow Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development approach for all new features and bug fixes:

**🔴 Red Phase - Write Failing Test:**
```typescript
// Example: Testing a new tool before implementation
describe('CreateNoteAdvanced', () => {
  it('should create note with frontmatter and tags', async () => {
    const tool = new CreateNoteAdvanced();
    const result = await tool.execute({
      title: 'Test Note',
      content: 'Content',
      frontmatter: { author: 'test' },
      tags: ['test']
    }, mockContext);
    
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    expect(result.data.frontmatter.author).toBe('test');
  });
});
```

**🟢 Green Phase - Make Test Pass:**
```typescript
// Implement minimal code to pass the test
export class CreateNoteAdvanced extends BaseTool {
  async execute(params: CreateNoteParams): Promise<ToolResult> {
    // Minimal implementation to pass test
    const note = await this.createNoteWithFrontmatter(params);
    return { success: true, data: note };
  }
}
```

**🔵 Refactor Phase - Improve Code:**
```typescript
// Clean up and optimize after tests pass
export class CreateNoteAdvanced extends BaseTool {
  async execute(params: CreateNoteParams): Promise<ToolResult> {
    this.validateParams(params);
    const note = await this.createOptimizedNote(params);
    return this.formatResult(note);
  }
  
  private validateParams(params: CreateNoteParams): void {
    // Extracted validation logic
  }
}
```

**🎯 TDD Application in Obsius:**

**For Provider Development:**
1. Write test for authentication flow
2. Implement minimal auth logic
3. Refactor for security and performance

**For Tool Development:**
1. Define expected tool behavior in test
2. Implement core functionality
3. Add error handling and validation

**For UI Components:**
1. Test user interaction scenarios
2. Build component to satisfy tests
3. Optimize rendering and state management

**📁 Test Organization:**
```
tests/
├── unit/
│   ├── tools/           # Tool-specific tests
│   ├── providers/       # Provider tests
│   └── utils/          # Utility function tests
├── integration/
│   ├── workflows/      # End-to-end user workflows
│   └── providers/      # Cross-provider integration
└── fixtures/           # Test data and mocks
```

**🔧 TDD Best Practices:**
- Keep test cycles short (Red-Green-Refactor in minutes, not hours)
- Write the simplest test that could possibly fail
- Implement only enough code to make the test pass
- Refactor with confidence knowing tests will catch regressions
- Use descriptive test names that explain behavior
- Mock external dependencies (Obsidian API, network calls)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for tools and providers (following TDD)
- Integration tests for chat workflows
- Manual testing for UI and user experience

## Development Notes

- **Plugin API**: Uses Obsidian's ItemView for sidebar integration
- **Build System**: esbuild with TypeScript compilation
- **Styling**: CSS custom properties for theme compatibility  
- **Security**: No plaintext API key storage, proper input validation
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, efficient DOM updates, memory management
