## Project Overview

Obsius aims to provide a CLI-style AI agent interface within Obsidian, similar to ClaudeCode, Gemini CLI, and OpenHands. The plugin will allow users to interact with AI agents to perform various operations on their Obsidian vault and notes.

## Key Features (Planned)

- CLI-style command interface within Obsidian
- Multi-provider AI support (Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Obsidian-specific operations (note manipulation, vault management)
- Tool system for extensible functionality
- Session management for persistent conversations
- Integration with Obsidian's existing UI and workflows
