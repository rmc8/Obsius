2. **Structure Planning** - Determine appropriate note organization
3. **Content Research** - Gather information from knowledge base and web
4. **Template Selection** - Choose appropriate template if available
5. **Content Generation** - Create structured, comprehensive content
6. **Metadata Addition** - Add tags, aliases, and frontmatter

### Template-Based Creation

**Command Examples**:
```
> create meeting notes for "Project Alpha Review"
> new daily note for today

- Suggests integration with existing notes

## 2. Smart Link Generation

### Automatic Link Detection

**During Note Creation**:
- Scans generated content for terms matching existing note titles
- Identifies concepts that have dedicated notes in vault
- Creates links automatically with user confirmation

**Retroactive Linking**:
```
> find and create links for the current note
> link all notes about "artificial intelligence" 
> create bidirectional links between related research notes
```

### Link Types and Strategies

#### Direct Title Links
- Links to notes with exact title matches
- Case-insensitive matching
- Alias support (e.g., "ML" → "Machine Learning")

#### Concept-Based Links
- Identifies related concepts across notes
- Uses semantic similarity for matching
- Creates contextual links with surrounding text

#### Hierarchical Links
- Parent-child relationships (e.g., "AI" → "Machine Learning" → "Neural Networks")
- Series links (e.g., "Part 1", "Part 2", "Part 3")
- Category links (e.g., all notes tagged with specific topics)

### Link Optimization

**Bidirectional Linking**:
- Ensures both notes reference each other
- Maintains link consistency
- Updates backlinks automatically

**Link Quality Assessment**:
- Evaluates relevance of proposed links
- Prevents over-linking (link spam)
