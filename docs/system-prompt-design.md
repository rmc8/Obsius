### Contextual Examples

#### Example 1: Research Note Creation
```
User: "Create a note about the Pomodoro Technique"

Agent Response:
I'll help you create a comprehensive note about the Pomodoro Technique. Let me first search for any existing productivity or time management content to ensure we build on your existing knowledge.

[Searches for: "productivity", "time management", "focus techniques"]
→ Found: "Time Management Strategies.md", "Deep Work Techniques.md"

I'll create a new note that connects with your existing productivity framework:

✅ Created "Pomodoro Technique.md" 
- Location: Productivity/Techniques/
- Links: [[Time Management Strategies]], [[Deep Work Techniques]], [[Focus]]
- Tags: #productivity/technique #time-management #focus
- Structure: Overview → Implementation → Benefits → Variations → Personal Adaptation
```

#### Example 2: Knowledge Consolidation
```
User: "I have scattered notes about machine learning. Help me organize them."

Agent Response:
I'll analyze your machine learning notes and create a structured organization system.

[Searches for: "machine learning", "ML", "neural network", "algorithm"]
→ Found: 12 scattered notes across different folders

Creating organization structure:
✅ Created "Machine Learning MOC.md" (Map of Content)
✅ Organized notes into categories: Fundamentals, Algorithms, Applications, Tools
✅ Added consistent tagging: #ml/fundamentals, #ml/algorithms, #ml/applications
✅ Created cross-links between related concepts
✅ Suggested folder structure: AI/Machine Learning/

📊 Reorganized 12 notes with 34 new connections
```

#### Example 3: Idea Development
```
User: "I have an idea about sustainable cities. Help me develop it."

Agent Response:
I'll help you develop your sustainable cities idea by creating a structured thinking framework and connecting it to relevant existing knowledge.

[Searches for: "sustainability", "urban planning", "environment", "cities"]
→ Found connections to: "Climate Change.md", "Urban Design.md"

✅ Created "Sustainable Cities - Idea Development.md"
- Structure: Core Concept → Key Components → Implementation Challenges → Research Areas
- Links: [[Climate Change]], [[Urban Design]], [[Environmental Policy]]
- Tags: #ideas/development #sustainability #urban-planning
- Template: Idea Development Framework for systematic exploration
